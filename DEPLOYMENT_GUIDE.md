# Deployment Guide - Therapios Flow Prototypes

## 🌐 Your Live Sites

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/TerenceBristol/therapios-flow-prototypes
- **Production Website**: https://flow-prototypes-kbqvjxugc-terences-projects-cb416d1c.vercel.app

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. ✅ **Git Repository**: Your code is version controlled
2. ✅ **GitHub**: All code is backed up on GitHub
3. ✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Your site is live and accessible
4. ✅ **Automatic Deployments**: Enabled! Every push to GitHub automatically deploys

## 🚀 How Automatic Deployment Works

**Simple Workflow:**
```
You make changes → Push to GitHub → Vercel automatically deploys → Your site updates!
```

Whenever you push code to your GitHub repository, Vercel will automatically:
- Detect the changes
- Build your Next.js application
- Deploy it to production
- Give you a live URL

**No manual deployment needed!** Just push to GitHub and Vercel does the rest.

## 📝 How to Deploy Updates (When I Help You)

When you need me to deploy changes, I'll:

1. **Save your changes** (commit them)
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/terence/Documents/Therapios Wireframes Updated/flow-prototypes"
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub** (this triggers automatic deployment)
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **That's it!** Vercel will automatically deploy within 1-2 minutes.

## 🔍 Monitoring Deployments

You can view your deployments at:
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/terences-projects-cb416d1c/flow-prototypes

Here you can:
- See deployment status
- View build logs
- Access all previous versions
- See deployment history
